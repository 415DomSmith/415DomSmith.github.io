Who I Am, and Why I'm Doing This:

My name is Dominic Smith, and I am an aspiring developer. 

The tl;dr version is I am a San Francisco native with a degree in Anthropology who is now trying to become a full-stack developer. To reach this goal, I am currently enrolled Galvanize's six month long [full-stack course](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/) in San Francisco.


The longer version is that I am also a veteran who deployed to Iraq and served as an all-source intelligence analyst in the Army. Since leaving the military in 2011, I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Anthropology (and a minor in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) from SF State in 2014. After looking for jobs in as a civilian intelligence jobs after college, I decided that in order to stay in the Bay Area (my home and the home of most of the people I care about) I would need to find a different career path. Enter [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/), and gSchool.

I have recently embarked on a journey to become a developer. In preparation for this journey I've done some self-learning, mainly through great resources like [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/), [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/), [Javascript is Sexy](http://javascriptissexy.com/), and [few dead-tree books](http://www.amazon.com/Jon-Duckett/e/B001IR3Q7I). 

What you are looking at now is my very first attempt at a legitimate site. All my other projects to date have been 'Hello World's' and tutorial exercises. This is ground zero, this is my foundation... and I promise that it only gets better from here.

I'm going to keep a blog during my education at Galvanize. In this blog, I'll talk about some of the lessons I have learned, and the curriculum at gSchool. As I get more advanced, I'll start including project diaries, and other fun stuff I discover along the way.

Until next time.

PS. This image came with the Jekyll theme. In honor of the themes creator, I'll leave it here.
